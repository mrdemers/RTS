When you're done doing something, 
log the change in here. Hopefully it
will help keep us organized

3/2/13: Unfortunitly, while putting in diagnostic System.out.println statements
to determine where player movement is processed, I somehow caused a bug that makes
movement spastic. I will now attempt to find what I changed and undo my damage.

3/2/13: changed the images variable of the tile class to an ArrayList, and added 
the "tree" tile. Most tile data is now stored in a different class, so that each
tile doesn't need to know any more variables than it needs to. 

3/2/13: Added the "resouces" package. Growing feeling I misspelled that...

3/2/13: Started unit facing the direction they are walking - Matt

3/3/13: Clicking on trees now cuts them down, and the harvester picks up wood
They can return it to a stockpile, but I have yet to implement the stockpile
getting the wood

3/3/13: Fixed the different walking directions. Added ability to scroll in and out of map,
but need to make it better - Matt

3/3/13: Changed stockpile to a building, need to change it so it doesn't involve tiles so much
Added rudimentary combat - Matt

3/4/13: Made buildings visable.

3/5/13: Changed the animation for units - Matt

3/6/13 Got combat slightly working - Matt

3/7/13: Worked on basic addingto/taking from stockpiles

3/7/13: Started the gui bar at the bottom and minimap, changed tile types so they need a color, 
		which is used in the minimap - Matt
		
3/9/13: Added a path class, which is what the unit class now uses instead of a list for the path.
		The path class has the getDistance method which you can use to see how many tiles the path
		takes from the start to end. Also changed the camera movement so you drag it with the right 
		mouse button. Need to fix it for when you have units selected. - Matt
		
3/10/13: Camera follows units you make move. - Matt
		 -Took that out now
		 
3/22/13: Started work on the FOW. Will make it look better - Matt

4/2/13: Got FOW to work, look better, minimap reflects it - Matt

4/6/13: wrote algorithim to check for nearest stockpile, but can't test it 
	due to program running at 1 fps on my computer
